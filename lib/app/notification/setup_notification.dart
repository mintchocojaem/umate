/// Working example of FirebaseMessaging.
/// Please use this in order to verify messages are working in foreground, background & terminated state.
/// Setup your app following this guide:
/// https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/flutter/client#platform-specific_setup_and_requirements):
///
/// Once you've completed platform specific requirements, follow these instructions:
/// 1. Install melos tool by running `flutter pub global activate melos`.
/// 2. Run `melos bootstrap` in FlutterFire project.
/// 3. In your terminal, root to ./packages/firebase_messaging/firebase_messaging/example directory.
/// 4. Run `flutterfire configure` in the example/ directory to setup your app with your Firebase project.
/// 5. Run the app on an actual device for iOS, android is fine to run on an emulator.
/// 6. Use the following script to send a message to your device: scripts/send-message.js. To run this script,
///    you will need nodejs installed on your computer. Then the following:
///     a. Download a service account key (JSON file) from your Firebase console, rename it to "google-services.json" and add to the example/scripts directory.
///     b. Ensure your device/emulator is running, and run the FirebaseMessaging example app using `flutter run`.
///     c. Copy the token that is printed in the console and paste it here: https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/blob/01b4d357e1/packages/firebase_messaging/firebase_messaging/example/lib/main.dart#L32
///     c. From your terminal, root to example/scripts directory & run `npm install`.
///     d. Run `npm run send-message` in the example/scripts directory and your app will receive messages in any state; foreground, background, terminated.
///  Note: Flutter API documentation for receiving messages: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/flutter/receive
///  Note: If you find your messages have stopped arriving, it is extremely likely they are being throttled by the platform. iOS in particular
///  are aggressive with their throttling policy.
///
/// To verify that your messages are being received, you ought to see a notification appearon your device/emulator via the flutter_local_notifications plugin.
/// Define a top-level named handler which background/terminated messages will
/// call. Be sure to annotate the handler with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` above the function declaration.
